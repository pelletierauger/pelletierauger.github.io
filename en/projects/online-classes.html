    <span class="small-caps">If you&rsquo;re working</span> on creative coding projects, or want to get into the field, it would be my pleasure to help you with online classes. The lessons would be delivered via Zoom, or any other videochat platform you might prefer.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on your needs, we could build a personalized curriculum that would allow you to progress at a satisfying and engaging pace. Despite being a highly technical field, creative coding can be remarkably fun and intuitive to learn. I believe that a student can find enjoyment at every step of the way, if the learning curve is just steep enough to be exciting, but not enough to be intimidating.

    Don&rsquo;t hesitate to <a href="https://pelletierauger.com/en/about.html#contact"><span id="Genericons">&#62480;</span>contact me</a> for any questions about your creative ideas and how I might help you to achieve them. My current fee for the lessons is <span class="lnum">35</span> CA$ per hour (about <span class="lnum">25.6</span> US$ or <span class="lnum">23.4</span> €).
</p>

<h3>Specific areas of expertise</h3>

<p class="noindent">
    p5.js, SuperCollider, WebGL Shaders, audioreactive projects, cellular automata, chaotic and dynamical systems.
</p>

<h3>Free educational material</h3>

<p class="noindent">
    <span class="small-caps">I’ve started to build</span> repositories for the educational material I’ve created so far, and you can access that material for free on GitHub. Find my <a href="https://github.com/pelletierauger/SuperCollider-Lessons">SuperCollider Lessons here</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/pelletierauger/Shader-Lessons">Shader Lessons here</a>.

<h3>Testimonial</h3>

<p class="noindent">
    <span class="small-caps">Here is a testimonial</span> written by one of my students:
</p>
<p>
“Studying with Guillaume is taking my live coding to a new level. He introduces complex topics in an extremely accessible, playful and entertaining way. I received a solid and comprehensive introduction to audio synthesis in SuperCollider, as well as the music theory required to listen and break down other musical performances to inform my own songwriting. It is a joy to be mentored by such a talented and passionate musician and performer. I also appreciate and am inspired by Guillaume’s commitment to share so many open source resources with the community.” &mdash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cymatiste-arts.com/">Sarah&nbsp;Imrisek</a>

<h3>About your teacher</h3>

<p class="noindent">
    <span class="small-caps">My creative coding journey</span> began with <a href="https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js/info">Introduction to Programming for the Visual Arts with <span class="lnum">p5.js</span></a><span class="cleardescenders">,</span> a free online course by Lauren McCarthy, Chandler McWilliams, and Casey Reas. My learning continued with Daniel Shiffman&rsquo;s excellent videos for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">The Coding Train</a>. I then started to code to compose and perform music with the help of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPYzvS8A_rTaNDweXe6PX4CXSGq4iEWYC">SuperCollider Tutorials</a> from Eli Fieldsteel.
</p>
<p>
    I&rsquo;ve been involved in creative coding and generative art since 2016, and prior to that I studied and worked in the arts, mostly in animation film, and also in independent comics, and illustration.
</p>
<p>
    Best of luck with all your projects, and let me know if you think I might be able to help you along the way.
