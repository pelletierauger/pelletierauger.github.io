After spending my youth near the Harricana River in Amos, Abitibi, and my adolescence by the Richelieu River in Saint-Ours, Montérégie, I moved to Montréal to study animation film at the Cégep du Vieux Montréal. I then studied graphic arts at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, Poland,

I produced and directed several short animation films that made the festival rounds from Beijing to &#381;ilina, passing through Bergamo, Boston, Brisbane, &#268;a&#269;ak, Kanazawa, Kochi, Melbourne, Nairobi, Ottawa, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sapporo, Singapore, Tāmaki Makaurau, Tokyo, Toronto, T&#345;ebo&#328;, Whitehorse, Wroc&#322;aw, and elsewhere.

    I&rsquo;m also involved in the Montréal independent comic book scene. My book <span class="italic">Mélasse</span> is published by L&rsquo;Oie de Cravan and was nominated for an Expozine Independent Press Award. My drawings and comic book stories can be found in publications like Liberté, L&rsquo;actualité, Planches, the collective edition of <span class="italic">Ping Pong</span> lead by Zviane at Pow Pow Press, and others.

<p>
    In 2016, I fell in love again with mathematics and programming, two things that lain dormant in me since the joyful moments when I learned to program with <span class="Silentype">HyperCard</span> at the age of 15. The tools of &ldquo;creative coding&rdquo; such as <span class="lnum">p5.js</span> and SuperCollider now allow me to unite my passion for the arts with my passion for writing algorithms and mathematical objects. I made this website to present these experiments.
</p>
<p>
    Inspired by the values of the <span class="small-caps">free software</span> movement, I share all my programming work freely. Unless otherwise noted, everything on this site can be reused, modified, and redistributed, as long as certain conditions (detailed in the licences) are met.

<!-- As a visual person, I&rsquo;m fascinated by the relationships between the form of things and their <span class="italic">meaning</span>. This has lead me to use mathematics and algorithms to explore various processes that generate images and movement. Everything around us is engorged and bursting with meaning and those meanings can be explored by interaction and inquiry. I first studied animation film at the Cégep du Vieux Montréal, and then took an illustration course at the International Summer Academy of Fine Arts in Salzburg, Austria. I then studied graphic arts at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw,

The <a href="https://github.com/pelletierauger/pelletierauger.github.io">source code for this application</a> is on GitHub (along with the source code for this whole website).
